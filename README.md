LRU and MGLRU ( Muti-Generational LRU ) in Rust

Get aways from LWN articles ( listed further down in the README ) for a general impl of MGLRU:
- MGLRU in kernel is very different and complex due to it being controlled by a variety of factors, small eg. access type file-based page or DMA by CPU, we will try to implement a much simpler version demonstrating just generational use
- There have to be two processes, one which marks what generation this data will be destined for, and other which actually changes the generation ( if it sounds similar to mark and sweep GC, then yes it is. In fact I think the whole idea of MGLRU is inspired from generational GCs )
- By default, new data access will land in younger generation
- A page's generation reflects its "age" â€” how long it has been since the page was last accessed.
- It's not yet merged as of 5.19 ( source: https://www.phoronix.com/news/MGLRU-v13-More-Benchmarks )
